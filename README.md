# elm-physics-2d

A simple physics engine in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) for games and simulations.

## Roadmap

### Features
- [x] Draw polygons
- [x] Draw circles
- [x] Animate movement and rotation
- [x] Set velocity and apply forces
- [x] Friction and maximum velocity
- [x] Collision detection for circles
- [ ] Collision detection for polygons
- [x] Collision response (removal)
- [ ] Collision response (elastic)
- [x] Collision response (custom)

### Issues
1. Object's "velocity" is confused with displacement per timestepâ€”what should it be?
1. What should units for rotational velocity be?
1. Incorrect translation between world units and screen units
1. Destructuring to check for `objectId` matches requires a pair of tuple pattern matches (clunky and brittle)
1. `World.viewSvg` should be moved out of `World` and into an example
