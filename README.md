# elm-physics-2d

A simple physics engine in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) for games and simulations.

## Roadmap

### Features
- [x] Draw polygons
- [x] Draw circles
- [x] Animate movement and rotation
- [x] Set velocity and apply forces
- [x] Friction and maximum velocity
- [x] Collision detection for circles
- [ ] Collision detection for polygons
- [x] Collision response (removal)
- [ ] Collision response (elastic)
- [x] Collision response (custom)

### Issues
1. Incorrect translation between world units and screen units in example
1. Lots of imports from elm-geometry and elm-units in example
